# ADF-X (Advanced Data Factory - eXperimental)

## Overview
ADF-X is an ambitious, groundbreaking project designed to create a highly modular, robust, and complex data generation factory. The primary objective is to produce synthetic data that can fulfil all possible variations, ensuring the data is as accurate and comprehensive as possible. ADF-X is not just a data generator; it's a complete data ecosystem tailored to be highly customizable, allowing users to specify the type of data they need, the number of iterations, and the expected amount of data.

## Components

### Admin AI
The Admin AI serves as the factory's starting point and user-friendly interface. It inquires about the user's specific needs, such as the phase for which the data is needed, the number of iterations, and the expected amount of data, thereby determining the course of action for the factory.

### OldData and OriginalData
Two mutable copies of the original dataset serve as the basis for data generation. `OldData` is actively worked upon for data generation, while `OriginalData` serves as a preserved reference copy.

### Rooms
The factory is divided into multiple "Rooms," each with a unique combination of data generation algorithms. These algorithms range from Simple Random Sampling, SMOTE, Gaussian Mixture Models, Monte Carlo Simulation, Rule-Based Generation, Data Perturbation to advanced machine learning models like GANs and VAEs.

#### Room 1
- All Algorithms + Simple VAE

#### Room 2
- All Algorithms + Simple GAN

#### Room 3
- All Algorithms + Simple VAE + Simple GAN

#### Room 4
- All Algorithms (No VAE or GAN)

### Post-Processing
After the data is generated in each Room, it undergoes refinement using complex GANs and VAEs versions. The data from each room is then combined into a final, highly nuanced, and accurate dataset.

## Workflow

1. **Admin Inquiry**: Determine user needs.
2. **Data Import**: Import preprocessed datasets for different phases.
3. **Room Processing**: Data is sent to Rooms based on user input.
4. **Post-Processing**: Further refinement of generated data.
5. **Output**: The final dataset meets the user's specifications.

## Usage
The factory is designed to be highly modular and customizable. Users can easily plug in different algorithms, adjust parameters, and add new "Rooms" as needed.

## Target
The ultimate aim of ADF-X is to be a one-stop solution for all data generation needs, whether for academic research, business analytics, or machine learning projects. It strives to produce a synthetic dataset that is not just large in volume but also rich in quality, ensuring that all possible data variations are covered.
